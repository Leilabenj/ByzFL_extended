# ByzFL_extended
Extending ByzFL for Fully Decentralized Learning This project enhances the ByzFL library by enabling fully decentralized federated learning without a central server. It implements peer-to-peer communication, gossip-based aggregation, and robust consensus mechanisms to ensure resilience against Byzantine failures.
